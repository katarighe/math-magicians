      Mathematics is the language of science. It is the language of logic and reason. It is the language of the universe. Without mathematics, we would not be able to understand the world around us. We would not be able to make predictions about the future. We would not be able to create new technologies. Mathematics is essential to our understanding of the world and our ability to shape it.
